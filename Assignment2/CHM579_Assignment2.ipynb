    "The objective of this assignment is to be able to run a simple program in the linux environment. These skills will form the basis of future assignments in the class. This assignment is divided into two parts, one for the creation of a basic Monte Carlo program and other for the Lennard-Jones equation of state. The first portion of the assignment will get you familiar with the linux environment and how FORTRAN programs are structured and compiled. The second part is a more realistic computational simulation and serves as a more in depth introduction to Monte Carlo."

    "The Monte Carlo simulation that is being run in this assignment is written in FORTRAN. Previously in this course, you have used Python which is an interpreted language. This means that the code is run line by line by a Python interpreter directly from the Python file with the code. FORTRAN is a compiled language which means that the code in the FORTRAN file is converted into a binary executable file which is run by the machine directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to complie a FORTRAN file, you can run the below command to compile the FORTRAN file `mc-001.f90` to the executable file `mc-001.out`\n",
    "\n",
    "`gfortran mc-001.f90 -o mc-001.out`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then run the executable file with the following command.\n",
    "\n",
    "`./mc‚Äê001.out`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you have an issue when running a file where it tells you that permission is denied you can attempt to fix the issue with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "chmod u+x [path_to_.out_file]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What this does is that it gives the user (you) executable permission on the file so that you are able to run it from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, all of the background code has been compiled for you. You will need to make some modifications to the final version of the code and then analyze the output. The kernel being used is Bash which you will need to install before starting the assignment. Run the following code to install the Bash kernel into your `assignment1` conda enviroment.\n",

    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the assignment, we will have 15 FOTRAN files with progressive code that builds upon the previousl file. For each step there will be the FORTRAN code, some comments on what code is being added, how the output should change, and a line of Bash code that will execute the correspond executable file. \n",
    "\n",
    "There will be an additional file called `mc-015_edit.f90` which is the file that you will edit. You can edit it in either\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before starting it is suggested that you switch over the the `Fortran_Code_Guide.ipynb` and run through notebook reading the comments, code, and output for each step.**"
