    "The [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/), or PDB, is the best place to obtain 3-Dimensional structures of proteins, nucleic acids, peptides and other macromolecules. From their site, you can locate proteins by keyword searching or by entering the accession number for the structure file, like 1mba. Most of the structures in the PDB were determined by [X-ray crystallography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_crystallography) or [NMR spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy) with a growing trend of using [Cryo-EM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenic_electron_microscopy). Details on the molecules in the structure file, how the structures were determined, pertinent research articles, etc. can be found on the web site but also in the pdb file itself.\n",

    "PDB files are just formatted text files, so you can open them in a text editor or even Word and read them. There is a wealth of information there! The molecular viewing programs use the ATOM records in the file, which contain residue name, residue number, atom name and atom number - all of which are important when selecting molecules or parts of them to visualize. Often, the structure files include other molecules besides the protein, such as water molecules, nucleic acid and bound ligands."
