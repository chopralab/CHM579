    "In this lab you will learn the basics of using the GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulations (GROMACS) package. The first system to study is liquid water by using a simple [SPC/E model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_model). You will learn how to obtain thermodynamic observables, such as the potential energy, as well as structural and dynamic properties of the system. This is arguably the most important lab in the course. Much of the information needed to complete this lab is available in the GROMACS online manual. Refer to the manual first, before asking technical questions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before running any GROMACS commands, you need to load the GROMACS module on the [node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(computer_science)) that you are using. By loading a module you will add paths to GROMACS into your environment settings. In other words, as GROMACS is not a conventional program that you use every day, you need to tell the supercomputer that you want to run GROMACS, so that it will prepare all the things it needs to do it.\n",

    "Similarly to the Monte Carlo program of Assignment 3, GROMACS uses an input file (.tpr). However, the input file (.tpr) does not exist and has to be generated. In order to prepare GROMACS’ input file (.tpr) you will need to execute the grompp command, which needs three files to run: the topology file (.top), molecular structure file (.gro), and the parameters file (.mdp).\n",

    "For this lab, the topology file (.top) and molecular structure file (.gro) are provided so you do not need to worry about them for now. Nevertheless, you will need to modify the parameters file (.mdp) at various steps of this procedure. IMPORTANT: On the GROMACS manual webpage you will find a thorough explanation of the parameters file format and of its general use. Refer to: [MDP](https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2018/user-guide/mdp-options.html)\n",

    "**Take a look at these files**. They are located at the ~/CHM579/lab4a/ directory: `topol.top`, `conf.gro`, and `grompp.mdp`.

For example, the parameter -f means that an explicit parameters file (.mdp) will be used, -c indicates the name of the molecular structure file (.gro), -p is to use a specific topology file (.top), and -o is to give a name to the input file that is going to be generated.
