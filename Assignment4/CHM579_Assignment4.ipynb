    "## Part 1 - Molecular Dynamics with NAMD & VMD\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the assignment deals with running simulations and understanding how to analyze output from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The output of a MD program is a series of time-resolved coordinates for all of the atoms in the simulation. The code widely used in the MD community is GROMACS. It is one of the fastest MD software out there. Due to the complexity of using the code (only for Linux and MacOS and assumes Linux/Unix background), it would not be fair for all students to run simulations with it. Thus, we have decided to use NAMD, a MD simulation program developed by Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group at UIUC in conjunction with VMD, the molecular viewing program. \n",
    "\n",
    "VMD has the capability to work with NAMD in order to display the results of a simulation as they are calculated (Interactive MD). As new atomic coordinate timesteps are generated by the simulation process, they can be transferred directly over to VMD, which can then animate the molecule. A major new feature in VMD is the ability to add perturbative steering forces to a running simulation, which are incorporated directly into the dynamics calculation. You will run both Interactive MD and Steered MD for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to complete this assignment, you will require to have up-to-date versions of the following software, properly installed on your computer, as mentioned on the NAMD tutorial website:\n",
    "\n",
    "- VMD: a molecular graphics program. This software is developed by the Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group. You can download it for free from [VMD website](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/current/docs.html#tutorials). We encourage you to go through the VMD tutorial at [VMD website](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/current/docs.html#tutorials) and also the [VMD tutorial](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~gchopra/class/public/pages/VMD_tutorial/), which we created prior to using the NAMD tutorial mentioned below. You should have experience with VMD from Assignment #1. You will need some extensions for using NAMD with VMD for [Interactive Molecular Dynamics](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/imd/tutorial/) (IMD) which can be found in the tutorial at [VMD website](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/current/docs.html#tutorials).\n",
    "\n",
    "- [NAMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/): a molecular dynamics simulation program. This software is also developed by the Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group. You can download it for free from NAMD website.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A text editor: We have a few easy-to-use recommendations.\n",
    "    - UNIX: vi editor, emacs, any other editor you prefer\n",
    "    - Mac OS X: Terminal, TextEdit (included with OS)\n",
    "    - Windows XP: WordPad (included with OS).\n",
    "\n",
    "A command prompt:\n",
    "- UNIX: Terminal\n",
    "- Mac OS X: Terminal.app\n",
    "- Windows XP: DOS command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "For windows users, a proper work path should be set for the installed softwares. Suppose these softwares are installed under the following directories:\n",
    "- VMD: C:\\Program Files\\University of Illinois\\VMD,\n",
    "- NAMD: C:\\NAMD,\n",

    "### Part 1A: Deca-alanine in vacuum\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things simple for you we have chosen a tutorial from the NAMD website which you can replicate with different parameters and actually run simulations on your computer. You would be simulating deca-alanine in vacuum. A biologically relevant simulation would involve water molecules but in this case one can get to know a lot about structural features in deca-alanine in vacuum as time progresses in the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deca-alanine tutorial will get you started with NAMD. You can get the pdf file for the tutorial [here](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~gchopra/class/public/assignments/tutorials/deca_alanine/10Ala-tutorial.pdf). **Please NOTE that only pages 1-11 are relevant in the tutorial**, though you can read further to get an idea of TCL. A feature of NAMD is that we can use TCL scripting language for analysis and simulation. We **do not** expect you to do any programming in TCL for the purpose of this assignment. Thus, we would be providing all the files needed to start the simulation. You should use **VMD Extension** for analysis as mentioned in the [VMD tutorial](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/current/docs.html#tutorials). Please feel free to look for any good tutorials for VMD analysis for MD online, but **ALWAYS** reference it. We would try to update the [VMD tutorial](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/current/docs.html#tutorials) on the [VMD website](http://chopra-modules.science.purdue.edu/class/chm579/spring2019/public/pages/VMD_tutorial/) as well, to help with this assignment. You would only need to **change the parameters** for different simulations as asked below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download and install the latest version of VMD and NAMD on your computer. Download the [tar-zipped set-up files](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~gchopra/class/public/assignments/tutorials/deca_alanine/10Ala-tutorial-files.zip) to get you started with the simulation. Please make sure that the current directory contains all the files downloaded. For windows users, create a folder files and download all the set-up files in this directory. At the command prompt make files as the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Interactive MD is for you to see how does the deca-alanine behaves with simulation. Follow the instructions in the tutorial for Interactive MD:\n",
    "    - See how the molecule behaves as the simulation progresses. Play with putting the forces on different atoms etc. and see what happens.\n",
    "    - The file imd.namd is the simulation parameter file used by NAMD for Interactive MD. To view the simulation longer, change the parameter run (the last line of the file) from 100000 to 1000000 (these are the number of steps in simulation). As the timestep parameter in the **imd.namd** file is set to 2 fs, the simulation with 100000 steps is 200ps and with 1000000 steps is 2 ns. The parameter temperature is the temperature at which the simulation takes place, which is set to 300K, i.e. room temeperature. **Note** that as you increase the number of steps for simulation, the longer it will take for the simulation to stop. Thankfully there is a Stop Simulation button in VMD for the interactive mode. Feel free to change any parameters you want and see the effect of changing parameter with MD. This interactive simulation helps you understand how the alpha-helix behaves and would help you answer the following questions:\n",
    "        - Is the deca-alanine stable in vacuum at room temperature?\n",
    "        - What is the effect of temperature on simulation, i.e. what do we expect when we increase the temperature from 300K to 400K and 450K?\n",
    "        - Can we change the temperature and achieve refolding of the deca-alanine?\n",
    "        - During unfolding of the alpha-helix, does it unfold from one end or from both ends or the center of the deca-alanine. Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) for 500 ps on deca-alanine in vacuum at **300K, 400K and 450K** by changing the parameters in the **smd.namd** file. **Note** this is not an interactive MD but you should analyze the MD trajectory using VMD. You will notice that the SMD uses smd.tcl file for the force it applies on the atoms in simulation as explained on **page 9** of the [tutorial](http://chopra-modules.science.purdue.edu/class/chm579/spring2019/public/assignments/tutorials/deca_alanine/10Ala-tutorial.pdf). Feel free to change the force-constant (k) paramter in the smd.tcl file to make the simulation work for 500ps.\n",
    "    - Plot the following using VMD **for each temperature of simulation** and explain your observation for each plot in 2-3 sentences:\n",
    "        - Obtain Ramachandran plots for the first and last frame using VMD. See if you can find something interesting at some point between the start and then end of the trajectory. Additional resources on Ramachandran plots can be found at these two links - [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramachandran_plot) and [link](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/ramaplot/)\n",
    "        - Graph end to end distance during the simulation vs Time for all temperatures.\n",
    "        - Graph Force vs Time for all temperatures.\n",
    "        - Graph % Helicity vs Time for all temperatures. (We are not looking for a quantitative estimate, a qualitative plot of secondary structure is fine for this)\n",
    "        - Graph RMSD vs Time for all temperatures.\n",
    "        - Graph Potential Energy vs Time for all temperatures.\n",
    "        - Graph Number of Hydrogen Bonds vs Time for all temperatures. (use the definition of hydrogen bonds as mentioned in the [deca-alanine tutorial](http://chopra-modules.science.purdue.edu/class/chm579/spring2019/public/assignments/tutorials/deca_alanine/10Ala-tutorial.pdf)).\n",
    "        - For number of Hydrogen bonds with time, we made a [simple TCL script](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~gchopra/class/public/assignments/ass3_files/h-bonds.tcl) which can be used to get the numHbonds. Please save this file in your current directory with all the output and input for NAMD. When you load your trajectory in VMD, go to Analysis and then TK Console. Make sure that the path to this is the path of your NAMD working directory ( i.e. where you have your simulation input and output files). You can get the output for the number of H-bonds with time, in the file numHbonds.dat when you invoke the command in the Tk console:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        **source h-bonds.tcl**\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Please refer to the tutorial if you have problems with using tk console. You can then use the plot command in the console or open this file in Excel (or your favorite plotting program) and plot the number of hydrogen bonds with time.\n",
    "    - Answer the following questions:\n",
    "        - From the above plots, approximately how much force is needed to unfold the alpha-helix at different temperatures? Are these forces different, why?\n",
    "        - Describe in a few sentences what do you expect when water is added to the system -- How does temperature play a role when water is added? What happens to the alpha-helix? Is it still stable in water?\n",
    "    - Please note that running the simulation once does not give accurate results in comparison to the experiments. Thus, always in MD, an ensemble average is taken for any property of the system analyzed. As the purpose of this assignment was to get you fimiliar with MD, doing multiple simulations for different starting configurations of the system is beyond the scope of this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2 - Molecular Dynamics set-up with Gromacs\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the assignment deals with running simulations and understanding how to set-up simple systems with Gromacs and understand the output from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. For this part of the assignment, please follow the instructions in the PDF files given below and answer the questions asked in the files:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2A: Molecular Dynamics of Solvated Acetone\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the file required to do this assignment is [here](http://chopra-modules.science.purdue.edu/class/chm579/spring2020/public/assignments/ass5_files/acetone.zip).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to become more comfortable with running simulations in GROMACS and to learn how to create your own input files for basic simulations. The system of study is a single acetone molecule (CH3)2CO solvated in SPC/E water.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab procedure assumes independent work with GROMACS manual. Refer to the previous lab for general information about running GROMACS.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [The GROMACS manual website](http://manual.gromacs.org/current/)\n",
    "- [GROMACS tutorials website](http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/Tutorials)\n",
    "- [Scholar’s User Guide](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/knowledge/scholar/all)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lab Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the acetone model from the paper [“Kirkwood-Buff derived force field for mixtures of acetone and water”](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.1574773) by S. Weerasinghe and P. E. Smith (J. Chem. Phys. 118, p 10663, 2003). This model corresponds to the united atom type: the methyl groups are represented by a single interaction site.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the starting example files from the CHM579 server.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Simplify the acetone model by making it rigid using constraints. Be sure to understand the molecular geometry before going to the next step. Calculate how many constraints are needed to have fully rigid acetone molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write a topology file (topol.top) for a system containing only one acetone molecule and no water. Table I in the paper is useful for specifying geometry of acetone. Check the structure of the topology file from previous examples. Look through Chapter 5: Topologies and read carefully Section 5.7: Find the combination rules that were used in the paper and invoke those rules in the [default] section, see Table II in particular.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create a coordinate file (conf.gro) for a single acetone molecule contained in a simulation box of approximately 1.8 x 1.8 x 1.8 nm3. You don't need to have a perfect structure.\n",
    "    - IMPORTANT: You can get the geometry of acetone from the [Computational Chemistry Comparison and Benchmark Database](https://cccbdb.nist.gov/).\n",
    "    - WARNING: The coordinate file conf.gro has a fixed format. The columns are in fixed positions. Refer to section 5.7.6.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. Check that you can actually run a short simulation of this isolated acetone molecule, 10 steps are enough. Remember that to run the simulation you must load the GROMACS module first, then execute grompp, and finally mdrun. Read the output of these two programs, and pay attention to error and warning messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Check the trajectory from the simulation with VMD or PyMOL\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disucssion\n",
    "\n",
    "You may continue with the following only after steps 2 through 5 were completed successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "(A) Include [moleculetype] SOL for the SPC/E water model in the topology file.\n",
    "\n",
    "GROMACS provides an auxiliary script genbox to fill the simulation box with water molecules. Check gmx genbox -h and carefully read the program help and manual. Use gmx genbox to solvate your initial simulation box that has the solitary acetone molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The genbox command is now obsolete in newer versions of GROMACS, you should use the [solvate](http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/lysozyme/03_solvate.html) command instead. If there are issues with accessing the spc216.gro file, please download it from [this GitHub link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gromacs/gromacs/master/share/top/spc216.gro)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visualize your new conformation with VMD. Take a snapshot of your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "(B) Equilibrate a system to T=300 K and P=1 atm. For that, you need to equilibration stages: a 50 ps of NVT, and 100 ps of NPT (with stochastic dynamics, integrator=sd).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Check that temperature and pressure have correct values. After that, perform a short molecular dynamics simulation under NPT conditions, 100-200 ps should be enough.\n",
    "3. Calculate the radial distribution function for every pair of [atomtypes].\n",
    "4. Describe details of your simulations: number of molecules in simulation, temperature, pressure, cut-off distances, length and time step of simulation, etc.\n",
    "5. Describe the force fields used and the interactions that are included in these force fields.\n",
    "6. Describe constraints if any.\n",
    "7. Plot RDFs for each pair of atom types.\n",
    "8. Compare RDFs between water sites with those from the previous lab. Comment on any differences you observe.\n",
    "9. Discuss shapes of acetone-water RDFs. Do they make sense to you?\n",
    "10. Based on the positions of the first peaks in the water-acetone RDFs, make a hand sketch of the first water shell around the acetone molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extra Credit\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Include the harmonic bonds, angle, and improper dihedral in topology file. You may use information in Table 1. Equilibrate the system and perform calculations in NPT ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate RDFs.\n",
    "2. Discuss the both simulations.\n",
